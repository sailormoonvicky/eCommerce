## Purpose
As a team we developed this Consumer Products Recommender system as our final project at the 10-week bootcamp at Le Wagon.
The goal was to enhance the performance of an eCommerce retailer through implementing a recommendation system which aims to increase the conversion rate and average order value of the online store

## Structure of the project
To create a valuable customer journey on the eCommerce platform, we defined 3 important momentums where we can influence customer behavior in order to increase the conversion rate and number of purchases:

- <font color=red>**Catch attention** : displaying the most popular brands and best-selling products </font>
- **Facilitate choice** : providing a meaningful selection of products that are relevant based on the customer's first click
- **Enrich basket** : using the cross-selling method, the system recommends additional complementary product to increase the unit per transaction.
